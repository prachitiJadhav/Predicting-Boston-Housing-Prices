# Predicting-Boston-Housing-Prices
Data Mining Project
Predicting Boston Housing prices using multiple linear regression. The goal of this project was to predict the median house price in new areas based on various factors such as crime rate, pollution, and number of rooms.

I began by exploring, cleaning, and preprocessing the dataset by uploading it into Python, determining the data frame dimensions, displaying the column titles, and converting them into one-word titles. I also converted object data types into dummy variables and displayed descriptive statistics for all columns.

Next, I developed multiple linear regression models with all 13 predictors and then used the Backward Elimination, Forward Selection, and Stepwise algorithms to identify the best predictors for the model. I trained new models using the respective training data set predictors and 80%-20% partition of the data set, identified the intercept and regression coefficients of the models, and compared the accuracy measures for the validation data set of the 4 linear regression models.

Based on the value of RMSE and the number of variables in each model, I recommended using the multiple linear regression model with the Forward Selection algorithm for making predictions in this case.

Overall, this project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, multiple linear regression, and algorithm selection for feature selection.
